Trend No. 9: Practical Blockchain

A blockchain is an expanding list of cryptographically signed, irrevocable transactional records shared by all participants in a network.49 Each record contains a time stamp and reference links to previous transactions. With this information, anyone with access rights can trace back a transactional event, at any point in its history, belonging to any participant. A blockchain is one architectural design of the broader concept of distributed ledgers. Blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies provide trust in untrusted environments, eliminating the need for a trusted central authority. Blockchain has become the common shorthand for a diverse collection of distributed ledger products.
Blockchain potentially drives value in a number of different ways:

■ Blockchain removes business and technical friction by making the ledger independent of individual applications and participants and replicating the ledger across a distributed network to create an authoritative record of significant events. Everyone with permissioned access sees the same information, and integration is simplified by having a single shared blockchain model.

■ Blockchain also enables a distributed trust architecture that allows parties that do not know or inherently trust one another to create and exchange value using a diverse range of assets.

■ With the use of smart contracts as part of the blockchain, actions can be codified such that changes in the blockchain trigger other actions.

Blockchain has the potential to reshape industries by enabling trust, providing transparency and enabling value exchange across business ecosystems — potentially lowering costs, reducing transaction settlement times and improving cash flow. Assets can be traced to their origin, significantly reducing the opportunities for substitutions with counterfeit goods. Asset tracking also has value in other areas, such as tracing food across a supply chain to more easily identify the origin of contamination or tracking individual parts to assist in product recalls. Another area in which blockchain has potential is identity management. Smart contracts can be programmed into the blockchain where events can trigger actions; for example, payment is released when goods are received.
According to the 2019 Gartner CIO Survey, 60% of CIOs expect some kind of blockchain deployment in the next three years.50 In terms of industries that have already deployed blockchain or plan to deploy it in the next 12 months, financial services leads the way (18%), followed by services (17%) and transportation (16%).51 It is likely that organizations in these industries have a greater need than organizations in other industries for the simpler use cases that limited use of some blockchain components can support, such as record keeping and data management.

Blockchain Will Be Scalable by 2023

Blockchain remains immature for enterprise deployments due to a range of technical issues including poor scalability and interoperability. Blockchain's key revolutionary innovation is that it eliminates all need for trust in any central or “permissioned” authority. It achieves that largely through decentralized public consensus, which is not yet used in enterprise blockchain, where organizations and consortia govern membership and participation. But enterprise blockchain is proving to be a key pillar in digital transformation that supports evolutionary and incremental improvements in trust and transparency across business ecosystems (see “Blockchain Unraveled: Determining Its Suitability for Your Organization”).
By 2023, blockchain will be scalable technically, and will support trusted private transactions with the necessary data confidentiality. These developments are being introduced in public blockchains first. Over time, permissioned blockchains will integrate with public blockchains. They will start to take advantage of these technology improvements, while supporting the membership, governance and operating model requirements of permissioned blockchains (see “Hype Cycle for Blockchain Technologies, 2019”).
Blockchain adds little value unless it is part of a network that exchanges information and value. The network collaboration challenges have initially driven organizations to turn to consortia to derive the most immediate value from blockchain. Choosing a consortium requires due diligence across numerous risk criteria before sharing data and engaging with an outside party. Understanding and evaluating these risks will be critical in extracting value from consortia involvement. Four types of consortia exist: technology-centric; geographically centric; industry-centric and process-centric. One option is to work with an industrywide consortium, but other types of consortia are also worth exploring. Organizations need to carefully consider how these consortia will impact the enterprise participation in particular industries and the competitive landscape.

Blockchain Use Cases

Gartner has identified multiple use cases for blockchain. These include:

1.	Asset Tracking. These use cases cover the tracking of physical assets through the supply chain to identify location and ownership accurately. Examples include tracking of automobiles through loan processes, artworks postsale, and locations of ocean freight and spare parts.

2.	Claims. This category covers automated claims processing in areas such as automobile, agriculture, travel, and life and health insurance. It also includes other claims, such as processing product recalls.

3.	Identity Management/Know Your Client (KYC). This category covers uses where records must be securely tied to an individual. Examples include managing records of educational achievement, patient health, election identity and national identities.

4.	Internal Record Keeping. In these use cases, the data to be secured remains within an individual organization. Examples include master data management, internal document management, purchase order and invoice records, and treasury record keeping.

5.	Loyalty and Reward. This category includes use cases for tracking loyalty points (for retailers, travel companies and others) and providing internal rewards, such as to employees or students.

6.	Payment/Settlement. Use cases in this category involve a payment between parties, or settlement of a trade. Examples include royalty payments, stock settlements, interbank payments, commercial lending, procure-to-pay processing and remittance processing.

7.	Provenance. Similar to the asset-tracking use case, this covers recording the movement of assets, but the aim is to show the full history and ownership of the asset, rather than its location. Examples include: tracking biological samples and organs; establishing the provenance of wine, coffee, fish and other foods; certifying the authenticity of components; and tracking pharmaceuticals through their life cycle.

8.	Shared Record Keeping. This category includes use cases where data needs to be shared securely between multiple participants. Examples include corporate announcements, multiparty hotel booking management, recording of flight data and regulatory reporting.

9.	Smart Cities/the IoT. This group includes use cases that use blockchain to provide data tracking and to control functions for smart spaces or IoT solutions. These include peer-to-peer energy trading, administration of electric vehicle charging, smart grid management and control of wastewater systems.

10.	Trade Finance. These use cases aim to streamline the process of financing trades, including managing letters of credit, simplifying trade finance and facilitating cross-border trade.

11.	Trading. Use cases in this group aim to improve the process for buying and selling assets, including dealing in derivatives, trading of private equity and sports trading.

As this technology evolves, Gartner predicts that at least three other use cases will become more viable and could prove the revolutionary benefits that blockchain enables:

■ Blockchain-based voting will benefit from improvements such as blockchain-related security, management of forks, system governance and ledger interoperability. Blockchain could also improve the tracking and traceability of voting tallies and voter rolls.

■ Blockchain-based, self-sovereign digital identity will also become more realistic. This could rationalize the maze of the many-to-many suboptimal identity verification systems and relationships used across the globe.

■ Cryptocurrency payments and remittance services will be used in countries with hyperinflation, with cryptocurrency preserving purchasing power and financial well-being.
Despite the challenges, the significant potential for disruption and revenue generation means you should begin evaluating blockchain, even if you don't aggressively adopt the technologies in the next few years. A practical approach to blockchain development demands:

■ A clear understanding of the business opportunity threat and potential industry impact

■ A clear understanding of the capabilities and limitations of blockchain technology

■ A reevaluation of your enterprise and industry trust architecture

■ The necessary vison and skills to implement the technology as part of core business strategy

■ A willingness and capability for customers to accept and adopt new operational constructs

Identify how the term “blockchain” is being used, both internally and by providers. Develop clear definitions for internal discussions. Use caution when interacting with vendors that have ill-defined/ nonexistent blockchain offerings or thinly veiled repackaging of legacy offerings as blockchain solutions.

Use Gartner's spectrum model of blockchain evolution to better assess ledger developments, including related initiatives, such as consensus mechanism development, sidechains and blockchains. Resources permitting, consider distributed ledger as a proof of concept (POC) development. But, before starting a distributed ledger project, ensure your team has the business and cryptographic skills to understand what is and isn't possible. Identify the integration points with existing infrastructures to determine the necessary investments, and monitor the platform evolution and maturation.
