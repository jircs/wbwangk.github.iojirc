 The Network Server to Application Server interface is outside the scope of this document. 
 
The primary focus of this document is to describe the message flow between the various 
entities of the network during the Over-the-Air Activation and Roaming Procedures of an 
End-Device.

End-Device: 
 
The End-Device is a sensor or an actuator. The End-Device is wirelessly connected to a 
LoRaWAN network through Radio Gateways. The application layer of the End-Device is
connected to a specific Application Server in the cloud. All application layer payloads of this 
End-Device are routed to its corresponding Application Server.

 LoRaWAN Backend Interfaces
 
 
 
 
 Radio Gateway: 
 
 The Radio Gateway forwards all received LoRaWAN radio packets to the Network Server
 that is connected through an IP back-bone. The Radio Gateway operates entirely at the 
 physical layer. Its role is simply to decode uplink radio packets from the air and forward them
 unprocessed to the Network Server. Conversely, for downlinks, the Radio Gateway simply 
 executes transmission requests coming from the Network Server without any interpretation
of the payload. 
 
 
Network Server:
 
The Network Server (NS) terminates the LoRaWAN MAC layer for the End-Devices
connected to the network. It is the center of the star topology.
 
Generic features of NS are: 
 End-Device address check,
 Frame authentication and frame counter checks, 
 Acknowledgements,
 Data rate adaptation,
 Responding to all MAC layer requests coming from the End-Device, 
 Forwarding uplink application payloads to the appropriate Application Servers,
 Queuing of downlink payloads coming from any Application Server to any End- 
Device connected to the network, 
 Forwarding Join-request and Join-accept messages between the End-Devices and
the Join Servers. 
 
In a roaming architecture, an NS may play three different roles depending on whether the 
End-Device is in roaming situation or not, and the type of roaming that is involved. 
 
Serving NS (sNS) controls the MAC layer of the End-Device.
 
Home NS (hNS) is where Device Profile, Service Profile, Routing Profile and DevEUI of the 
End-Device are stored. hNS has a direct relation with the Join Server that will be used for 
the Join Procedure. It is connected to the Application Server (AS). When hNS and sNS are
separated, they are in a roaming agreement. Uplink and downlink packets are forwarded 
between the sNS and the hNS.
 
Forwarding NS (fNS) is the NS managing the Radio Gateways. When sNS and fNS are 
separated, they are in a roaming agreement. There may be one or more fNS serving the
End-Device. Uplink and downlink packets are forwarded between the fNS and the sNS. 
 
 
Join Server:
 
The Join Server (JS) manages the Over-the-Air (OTA) End-Device activation process. There
may be several JSs connected to a NS, and a JS may connect to several NSs.
 
The End-Device signals which JS should be interrogated through the JoinEUI field of the
Join-request message. Each JS is identified by a unique JoinEUI value. Note that AppEUI
field of the Join-request in LoRaWAN 1.0/1.0.2 [LW10, LW102] is renamed to JoinEUI field
 in LoRaWAN 1.1 [LW11]. The term JoinEUI is used to refer to the AppEUI in the context of 
 LoRaWAN 1.0/1.0.2 End-Devices in this specification. 
 
 The JS knows the End-Deviceâ€™s Home Network Server identifier and provides that 
 information to the other Network Servers when required by the roaming procedures. 
 
 The JS contains the required information to process uplink Join-request frames and 
 generate the downlink Join-accept frames. It also performs the network and application 
 session key derivations. It communicates the Network Session Key of the End-Device to the 
NS, and the Application Session Key to the corresponding Application Server. 
 
For that purpose the JS SHALL contain the following information for each End-Device under
its control : 
 DevEUI
 AppKey
 NwkKey (only applicable to LoRaWAN 1.1 End-Device)
 Home Network Server identifier 
 Application Server identifier
 A way to select the preferred network in case several networks can serve the End-
Device 
 LoRaWAN version of the End-device (LoRaWAN 1.0, 1.0.2, or 1.1) 
 
The root keys NwkKey and AppKey are only available in the JS and the End-Device, and
they are never sent to the NS nor the AS.
 
Secure provisioning, storage, and usage of root keys NwkKey and AppKey on the End-
Device and the backend are intrinsic to the overall security of the solution. These are left to 
implementation and out of scope of this document. However, elements of this solution may
include SE (Secure Elements) and HSM (Hardware Security Modules). 
 
The way those information are actually programmed into the JS is outside the scope of this
document and may vary from one JS to another. This may be through a web portal for 
example or via a set of APIs. 
 
The JS and the NS SHALL be able to establish secure communication which provides end- 
point authentication, integrity and replay protection, and confidentiality. The JS SHALL also
be able to securely deliver Application Session Key to the Application Server.
 
The JS may be connected to several Application Servers (AS), and an AS maybe connected 
to several JSs. 
 
The JS and the AS SHALL be able to establish secure communication which provides end- 
point authentication, integrity, replay protection, and confidentiality. 
 

 
 Application Server: 
 
 The Application Server (AS) handles all the application layer payloads of the associated
 End-Devices and provides the application-level service to the end-user. It also generates all
 the application layer downlink payloads towards the connected End-Devices.
 
 There may be multiple ASs connected to a NS, and an AS may be connected to several NSs 
 (operating End-Devices through several networks, for example). An AS may also be 
 connected to multiple JSs. 
 
The Home NS routes the uplinks toward the appropriate AS based on the DevEUI.
 
In addition to the aforementioned network elements, LoRaWAN architecture defines the 
following network interfaces among these entities:
 
hNS-JS: This interface is used for supporting the Join (Activation) Procedure between the JS
and the NS. 
 
vNS-JS: This interface is used for Roaming Activation Procedure. It is used to retrieve the 
NetID of the hNS associated with the End-Device.
 
ED-NS: This interface is used for supporting LoRaWAN MAC-layer signaling and payload
delivery between the End-Device and the NS. 
 
AS-hNS: This interface is used for supporting delivery of application payload and also the
associated meta-data between the AS and the NS.
 
hNS-sNS: This interface is used for supporting roaming signaling and payload delivery
between the hNS and the sNS.
 
sNS-fNS: This interface is used for supporting roaming signaling and payload delivery
between the sNS and the fNS.
 
AS-JS: This interface is used for delivering Application Session Key from the JS to the AS.
 
4 End-Device Types and States 
 
 There are two types of LoRaWAN End-Devices: Activation-by-Personalization (ABP)
 activated End-Devices, and Over-the-Air (OTA) activated End-Devices. ABP End-Devices
 are directly tied to a specific network by skipping the Join Procedure. OTA End-Devices 
 perform Join Procedure to get activated on a selected network. 
 
 Figure 3 shows the two types of End-Devices and various End-Device states associated with 
 
Figure 3 End-Device types and states
 
 
An ABP End-Device SHALL have the following information either when it leaves the 
manufacturer or upon configuration thereafter: DevAddr, AppSKey, network session keys.
Network session keys are SNwkSIntKey, FNwkSIntKey, and NwkSEncKey in case of a
R1.1, and NwkSKey in case of a R1.0/1.0.2 End-Device. For that End-Device to readily use 
the network, its Home NS SHALL have the DevAddr, network session keys, AS info of the
End-Device; and the AS SHALL have the DevAddr, AppSKey of the End-Device.
 
An OTA End-Device SHALL have the following information either when it leaves the 
manufacturer or upon configuration thereafter: DevEUI, NwkKey (R1.1-only), AppKey, 
JoinEUI. At this point it is called a Generic End-Device. The associated JS SHALL have 
DevEUI, AppKey, NwkKey (R1.1-only) of the End-Device. No NS or AS may have any
information about the Generic End-Device until it is commissioned. 
 
Reconfiguration of an End-Device may be possible during its lifecycle. Configuration and
reconfiguration procedure details are outside the scope of this specification.
 
 Commissioning procedure associates the End-Device with its Home NS and a specific AS.
 The JS of a commissioned OTA End-Device SHALL have the Home NS info for the End- 
 Device. The AS associated with the End-Device SHALL have the DevEUI of the End-Device. 
 The Home NS SHALL have various profile information related to the End-Device and its 
 service subscription. Mechanisms used for provisioning the AS, JS, and NS with the
 required information is outside the scope of this specification.
 
 When a commissioned OTA End-Device performs successful Join (Activation) Procedure, it
knows DevAddr, network session keys, and AppSKey. The JS knows the DevEUI, DevAddr, 
network session keys, AppSKey, and DevNonce. The JS delivers the DevEUI and AppSKey 
to the AS. The JS delivers the network session keys, and optionally the encrypted AppSKey 
to the NS. 
 
 
5 Commissioning Procedure 
 
 Commissioning Procedure is executed by the AS, JS (only applicable to OTA), and NS for a 
 given End-Device. It involves the JS associating the End-Device with a Home NS (only 
 applicable to OTA), the Home NS and the AS receiving the profile information related to the 
 End-Device and its service subscription. The mechanisms used for provisioning the required 
 information on the aforementioned network elements is outside the scope of this 
 specification.
 
Decommissioning Procedure breaks the association between the End-Device and the Home 
NS and the AS. This procedure involves resetting the state created on the AS and NS at the
time of commissioning, unbinding the End-Device and Home NS on the JS (only applicable
to OTA).
 
Details of the Commissioning and Decommissioning Procedures are outside the scope of
this specification.

6 Activation of ABP End-Devices 
 
 Figure 4 shows activation of an ABP End-Device with an NS. This procedure applies to both 
 R1.0 [LW10, LW102] and R1.1 [LW11] End-Devices and networks.
 
Figure 4 Activation of ABP End-Device
 
 
 Step 0: 
 
The End-Device, NS, and AS are configured with the required information, so that the End- 
Device can send packets as soon as it is powered on. 
 
Step 1:
 
When the End-Device has application payload to send, it can do so without performing any 
setup signaling with the network. The packet includes application payload that is encrypted 
using the AppSKey, and the MIC that is generated using the network session integrity keys 
(SNwkSIntKey and FNwkSIntKey in case of a R1.1 End-Device, and NwkSKey otherwise).
 
When the NS receives the packet, it SHALL perform network session integrity key lookup
based on the DevAddr of the received packet. The NS SHALL verify the MIC using the
retrieved keys. If the keys are not found, or if the MIC verification fails, the NS SHALL drop
 the packet.
 
Step 2:
 
The NS SHALL send the encrypted payload of the accepted packet to the AS associated 
with the End-Device. The application payload may be accompanied with the metadata, such 
as DevAddr, FPort, timestamp, etc. The NS SHALL consider receipt of the very first packet 
from the End-Device as the activation of a LoRa session for the End-Device. 
 
7 Activation of OTA End-Devices 
 
 OTA Activation Procedure is used by the End-Device in order to mutually authenticate with 
 the network and get authorized to send uplink and receive downlink packets. 
 
 NSs are categorized in two ways with respect to an End-Device. Home NS is the NS that
 holds the End-Device, Service, and Routing Profiles of the End-Device, and interfaces with
 the AS and the JS after any activation. The mechanism used for provisioning the Home NS 
 with the required profile information is outside the scope of this specification. On the other
hand, Visited NS is any other NS that has a business and technical agreement with the
Home NS for being able to serve the End-Device. 
 
There are two variants of the Activation Procedure, namely Activation at Home, and 
Roaming Activation.
 
Activation at Home: The End-Device performs the Activation Procedure within the radio
coverage of the Home NS. At the end of the procedure, the Home NS is the only NS serving 
the End-Device for reaching out to the AS and the JS. 
 
Roaming Activation: The End-Device performs the Activation Procedure outside the radio 
coverage of its Home NS but within the coverage of a Visited NS. In this procedure, the 
Visited NS learns the identity of the Home NS with the help of the JS and obtains the
required End-Device and Service Profiles from the Home NS. At the end of the procedure, 
the End-Device is served by both the Visited NS and the Home NS for reaching out to the
AS and the JS.
 
When the End-Device performs a successful Join or Rejoin Procedure, the End-Device is 
said to have a LoRa session with the backend. Each LoRa session is associated with a set 
of context parameters managed on the End-Device, and the NS, JS, and AS. (e.g., session 
keys, DevAddr, ID of NS, etc.). The LoRa session terminates when the End-Device performs
Deactivation (Exit) Procedure or another successful Join/Rejoin Procedure.
 
8 OTA Activation at Home Procedure
 
 Figure 5 illustrates the message flow for OTA Activation at Home Procedure. This
 procedure applies to both R1.0 [LW10, LW102] and R1.1 [LW11] End-Devices and 
 networks.
 
Figure 5 Message flow for OTA Activation at Home Procedure.
 
Step 1:
 
The End-Device SHALL transmit a Join-request message. 
 
Step 2:
 
When the NS receives the Join-request message, the NS SHALL determine whether it is the 
Home NS for the End-Device identified by DevEUI, or not.In this flow it is assumed that the 
NS is the Home NS of the End-Device. See Section 12 for the case where the NS is not the
Home NS of the End-Device, but the NS is configured to use the JS for Roaming Activation 
Procedure. If the NS is neither the Home NS of the End-Device nor configured to use the JS,
then the NS SHALL silently ignore the Join-request and the procedure terminates here. 
 
 The NS SHALL use DNS to lookup the IP address of the JS based on the JoinEUI in the
 received Join-request message (see Section 19), if the NS is not already configured with the
 IP address/hostname of the JS by an out-of-band mechanism. If DNS lookup fails, then the
 NS SHALL terminate the procedure here. 
 
 For R1.0 [LW10] End-Devices configured with an AppEUI not identifying a Join Server, the 
 NS SHOULD be configured with the IP address/hostname of the JS by an out-of-band 
 mechanism.
 
Step 3:
 
The NS sends a JoinReq message to the JS carrying the PHYPayload of the Join-request 
message, MACVersion, DevEUI, DevAddr, DLSettings, RxDelay, and optionally CFList. The
NS SHALL set the value of the MACVersion to the highest common version between the 
End-Device and the NS.
 
Step 4:
 
The JS SHALL process the Join-request message according to the MACVersion and send 
JoinAns to the NS carrying Result=Success, PHYPayload with Join-accept message,
network session keys (SNwkSIntKey, FNwkSIntKey, and NwkSEncKey in case of a R1.1,
and NwkSKey in case of a R1.0/1.0.2 End-Device), either the encrypted AppSKey or 
SessionKeyID or both, and Lifetime in case of success, and Result=UnknownDevEUI or
MICFailed in case of failure (e.g., if the End-Device is not recognized by the JS, or if the MIC 
of the Join-request fails the verification).
 
JS may create SessionKeyID which is associated with the generated session keys.
 
SNwkSIntKey, FNwkSIntKey, NwkSEncKey, and AppSKey are generated based on the
LoRaWAN 1.1 specification [LW11] for R1.1 End-Devices. NwkSKey is generated based on
the LoRaWAN 1 specification [LW10] for R1.0/R1.0.2 End-Devices. AppSKey is encrypted 
using a key shared between the JS and the AS when it is delivered from the JS to the NS.
 
For R1.0 [LW10] End-Devices, the JS SHALL process the Join-request message also when 
the AppEUI is not identifying the JS. 
 
Step 5:
 
The NS SHALL forward the received PHYPayload with Join-accept message to the End- 
Device if the received JoinAns message indicates Success.The End-Device SHALL
generate the network session keys, and AppSKey based on the LoRaWAN specification
[LW10, LW102, LW11] upon receiving the Join-accept message.
 
Step 6:
 
When the NS receives an uplink packet from the End-Device, the NS SHALL send the 
encrypted AppSKey or SessionKeyID or both along with the application payload to the AS.
 
Step 7:
 
When AS receives the encrypted AppSKey along with the application payload, then the AS
SHALL decrypt the AppSKey using a secret key shared between the JS and the AS, and
 use the AppSKey to decrypt the received payload. If the encrypted AppSKey is not made
 available by the NS, then the AS SHALL proceed to the next step.
 
 Step 8: 
 
 This step takes place in case the AS wants to receive the AppSKey directly from the JS.
 
 The AS SHALL request the AppSKey identified by the DevEUI of the End-Device and the
 SessionKeyID from the JS. The AppSKey is encrypted using a shared secret between the JS
and the AS. The JS sends the encrypted AppSKey, DevEUI and the SessionKeyID to the AS.
Then the AS SHALL decrypt the encrypted AppSKey using a secret key shared between the 
JS and the AS. Then, the AS starts using the AppSKey to encrypt and decrypt the application 
payload. 
 
OTA activation of a commissioned End-Device can happen both when the NS and the JS 
belong to the same administrative domain and when they belong to two separate 
administrative domains.
 
 
9 Deactivation (Exit) of OTA End-Devices
 
 LoRa session of an OTA-activated End-Device can also be terminated for various reasons,
 such as user reaching end of contract, malicious End-Device behavior, etc. The procedure
 used for deactivating the session is the Exit Procedure, which is the counter-part of the Join 
 Procedure.
 
 There is no explicit and dedicated LoRaWAN signaling for performing the Exit Procedure. It 
 is assumed that the End-Device and the backend rely on application-layer signaling to
perform this procedure. Triggers and the details of application-layer signaling are outside the 
scope of this specification.
 
When the hNS is notified about the Exit Procedure by the AS and there is a separate sNS,
then the hNS SHALL perform Handover Roaming Stop Procedure to convey the termination 
of the LoRaWAN session to the sNS. 
 
The End-Device successfully performing a new Join/Rejoin Procedure also terminates the 
current LoRaWAN session, and in a way, it can be considered as the Deactivation
associated with that session.
 
10 Security Associations 
 
Table 1 shows the security associations used by the LoRaWAN deployments. Some of the
required security associations will be detailed in the LoRaWAN specification, and some are 
left to the deployments.
 
Table 1 LoRaWAN security associations
 
11 Roaming Procedure
 
 11.1 Types of Roaming 
 
 There are two types of LoRa roaming, namely Passive Roaming and Handover Roaming.
 Passive Roaming enables the End-Device to benefit from LoRaWAN service of a Network
 Server (NS) even when the End-Device is using the Gateway(s) (GWs) under the control of
 another NS, within the limits of the overlapping RF capabilities (i.e., channels) of the two
 networks, for that End-Device. LoRa Session and the MAC-layer control of the End-Device
 are maintained by the former NS, which is called the Serving NS (sNS), whereas the frame 
forwarding to/from air interface is handled by the latter NS, which is called the Forwarding 
NS (fNS). There can only be one sNS for a given LoRa Session whereas zero or more fNSs
may be involved with the same session. 
 
There are two types of fNSs: Stateful and stateless. A stateful fNS creates context at the
onset of the passive roaming of an End-Device and utilizes that context for processing any 
subsequent uplink/downlink packets of the same End-Device. A stateless fNS does not
create any such context and therefore ends up having to process any uplink/downlink packet
independent of each other. It is assumed that whether a given fNS is stateless or stateful is 
known to its roaming partners by some out of scope mechanism. 
 
Handover Roaming enables the transfer of the MAC-layer control from one NS to another.
hNS maintains the control-plane and data-plane with the JS and the AS even after the End-
Device performs a Handover Roaming from one NS to another.hNS stays the same for a 
given LoRa Session until the End-Device performs the next Join Procedure. Unlike the fNS,
the sNS has capability to control the End-Device RF settings, which allows more flexible
roaming scenarios.
 
Figure 6 Use of Handover and Passive Roaming 
 
 Figure 6 illustrates an example case where both the Handover Roaming and Passive
 Roaming are used for a LoRa Session simultaneously. In this example, the End-Device was 
 activated through NS1 which acts as the hNS. Subsequently, the End-Device has performed
 Handover Roaming from NS1 to NS2 when NS2 became the sNS, and also Passive 
 Roaming from NS2 to NS3 when NS3 became the fNS for the End-Device.
 
Roaming activation is the capability for an End-Device to activate under the coverage of a 
Visited NS.
 
This specification describes the procedures for the following roaming cases:
 -Passive Roaming during an ongoing LoRa Session
 -Handover Roaming during an ongoing LoRa Session
 -Roaming Activation of a new LoRa Session based on Handover Roaming between 
the Home NS and the Visited NS 
 -Roaming Activation of a new LoRa Session based on Passive Roaming between the
Home NS and the Visited NS
 
Activation of a new LoRa Session when the Home NS and the Visited NS do not have any
roaming agreement is outside the scope of this specification. This includes the case where
the two NSs may have roaming agreement with a third NS (e.g., Home NS and 3rd NS 
having a Handover Roaming agreement, and the 3rd NS and the Visited NS having a 
Passive Roaming agreement). 
 
 
11.2 Roaming Policy 
 
Each network operator SHALL be configured with a roaming policy that can individually 
allow/disallow Passive Roaming, Handover Roaming, Passive Roaming based Activation, 
Handover Roaming based Activation with other network operators identified by their NetIDs.
For Passive Roaming, the policy SHALL also include whether the uplink MIC check is done 
by the fNS or not. 
 
Each network operator SHALL be configured with a roaming policy that can allow/disallow
 Passive Roaming, Handover Roaming, Passive Roaming based Activation, Handover
 Roaming based Activation of its individual End-Devices identified by the DevEUI.
 
 11.3 Passive Roaming
 
 This procedure applies to both R1.0 [LW10, LW102] and R1.1 [LW11] End-Devices and
 networks.
 
 11.3.1Passive Roaming Start
 
Figure 7 illustrates the message flow for Passive Roaming Procedure between two NSs for
an ongoing LoRa Session of an End-Device. Refer to Section 12.2 for Passive Roaming
based Activation of a new LoRa Session. 
 
Figure 7 Passive Roaming start 
 
 
Step 0:
 
The End-Device is activated through the NS1. 
 
Step 1:
 
When the End-Device transmits a packet, it is received by the NS2 which does not have any 
context associated with the End-Device. 
 
Step 2: 
 
 If the NS2 is configured to enable passive roaming with other network operators, then the
 NS2 SHALL attempt to map the NwkID in the received packet with the NetID(s) of the 
 operators with whom it has a passive roaming agreement. If no match is found, then the 
 NS2 SHALL discard the packet and the procedure terminates here. 
 
 Step 3: 
 
If one or more matching NetIDs are found, then the NS2 SHALL use DNS to lookup (see 
Section 19) the IP address of NS for each matching NetID (e.g., NS1 in this case), if the NS2 
is not already configured with the IP address/hostname of the NS by an out-of-band
mechanism. If there are more than one match, then Steps 4æœˆ6æ—¥ are executed for each 
matching NS.
 
Step 4:
 
The NS2 SHALL send a PRStartReq message to the NS1, carrying the PHYPayload of the 
incoming packet, and the associated ULMetadata. Details of metadata are described in
Section 16
 
Step 5:
 
The NS1 SHALL check if it already has a passive roaming agreement with the network 
operator identified by the received NetID, and decide to return a PRStartAns carrying 
Result=NoRoamingAgreement if no agreement is found.
 
The NS1 SHALL extract the DevAddr of the End-Device from the PHYPayload, identify the
corresponding network session integrity key (SNwkSIntKey and FNwkSIntKey in case of 
R1.1, and NwkSKey in case of R1.0/1.0.2 End-Device), and verify the MIC in the
PHYPayload. If the keys are not found or if the MIC verification fails, then the NS1 SHALL 
decide to return a PRStartAns carrying Result=MICFailed. 
 
Step 6:
 
If the identified End-Device is configured to use Passive Roaming and the NS1 decides to 
enable Passive Roaming via the NS2, then the NS1 SHALL send a PRStartAns to the NS2
carrying the Result=Success, and Lifetime associated with the Passive Roaming. The NS1
SHALL also include DevEUI and ServiceProfile if NS2 is to operate as a stateful fNS, and
FCntUp and FNwkSIntKey (in case of R1.1) or NwkSKey (in case of R1.0/1.02) in the 
PRStartAns message if NS1-NS2 Passive Roaming agreement requires the NS2 to perform
MIC check on the uplink packets.
 
If the NS1 does not wish to enable Passive Roaming via NS2 at this point in time, then it 
SHALL send a PRStartAns to the NS2 carrying Result=Deferred, and Lifetime. The NS2 
SHALL not send any more PRStartReq to the NS1 for the same End-Device for the duration
of Lifetime upon receiving this message.
 
If a failure has occurred at Step 5, then the NS1 SHALL send a PRStartAns to the NS2
carrying the identified Result.
 
The NS1 may receive PRStartReq from multiple NSs at the same time, and decide to enable
Passive Roaming with zero or more of them.
 
The NS1 and the NS2 SHALL terminate the Passive Roaming on their own (i.e., without
 involving additional signaling with each other) after the associated Lifetime expires, unless 
 the Passive Roaming is extended with a new round of PRStartReq/PRStartAns before the
 expiration. For stateless fNS operation, the NS1 SHALL set the value of Lifetime associated 
 with the Passive Roaming to zero. 
 
 Step 7: 
 
The NS2 becomes an fNS for the LoRa Session of the End-Device as soon as it receives 
the successful PRStartAns. NS1 continues to serve as the sNS.
 
After this point on, the NS2 SHALL forward packets received from the End-Device to the 
NS1, and the NS1 SHALL accept such packets from NS2. Also, the NS1 SHALL note the
NS2 as a candidate fNS for sending packets to the End-Device. The NS2 SHALL accept 
packets sent from NS1 to be forwarded to the End-Device via one of its GWs. 
 
 
11.3.2 Packet Transmission
 
 Figure 8 illustrates the message flow for an End-Device sending and receiving packets using 
 Passive Roaming. Even though the flow shows an uplink packet immediately followed by a 
 downlink packet, the uplink and the downlink parts of the flow can be executed 
 independently in any order as allowed by the class of the End-Device. 
 
 In case of stateless fNS procedure, each uplink packet SHALL be processed according to 
 Section 11.3.1 (not according to the Steps 1æœˆ4æ—¥ in this section, which assume stateful fNS).
 Nevertheless, Steps 5æœˆ11æ—¥ in this section are applicable to downlink packet processing even
 for stateless fNS procedure. 
 
All steps in this section are applicable to uplink and downlink packet processing in case of
stateful fNS procedure. 
 
Figure 8 Packet transmission using Passive Roaming
 
 
Step 0:
 
Stateful Passive Roaming is enabled between the fNS and the sNS for the End-Device.
 
Step 1:
 
 The End-Device transmits a packet, which is received by the fNS.
 
 Step 2: 
 
 If the fNS is required to perform MIC check on the uplink packets based on sNS-fNS Passive
 Roaming agreement, then the fNS SHALL extract the DevAddr of the End-Device from the 
 packet and identify the FNwkSIntKey/NwkSKey, and verify the MIC in the packet. If no 
 FNwkSIntKey/NwkSKey is found or if the MIC verification fails, then the fNS SHALL discard 
 the packet. 
 
Step3: 
 
If an End-Device is identified, the fNS SHALL send a XmitDataReq message to the identified 
End-Deviceâ€™s sNS carrying the PHYPayload of the received packet and the associated
ULMetadata. 
 
Step 4:
 
The sNS SHALL send a XmitDataAns message back to the fNS carrying Result upon
 receiving the XmitDataReq.
 
 The subsequent steps are executed when the sNS has a packet to send to the End-Device, 
 which may or may not follow the preceding steps.
 
 Step 5: 
 
 The sNS has a packet to send to the End-Device. 
 
 Step 6: 
 
 The sNS SHALL determine whether to send the packet via one of the GWs under its control
 or via a GW under the control of an fNS. 
 
 Step 7: 
 
 If the sNS decides to send the packet via an fNS, the sNS SHALL send XmitDataReq 
 message to the fNS carrying the PHYPayload of the packet, and DLMetadata. 
 
 Step 8: 
 
 If there is an error condition in the received XmitDataReq, the fNS SHALL send a
 XmitDataAns message to the sNS carrying Result set to a failure value and SHALL NOT
 attempt to transmit the packet. Otherwise, the fNS SHALL attempt to transmit the packet to
 the End-Device based on the metadata information it has received from the sNS. If the
 metadata includes GWInfo.ULToken, then the fNS may use that for selecting the downlink
 transmission GW. The fNS may fail to transmit the packet due to the timing constraints and 
 the network conditions. In that case, the fNS SHALL not retry transmission. 
 
 Step 9: 
 
 After attempting to transmit the packet, the fNS SHALL send a XmitDataAns message to the
 sNS carrying one or both of DLFreq1 and DLFreq2 (depending on whether the packet was
 transmitted at RX1 or RX2 or both) with Result=Success for successful transmission, and
 Result=XmitFailed value otherwise.
 
11.3.3 Passive Roaming Stop 
 
 Figure 9 and Figure 10 illustrate the message flows for terminating Passive Roaming. This 
 procedure is applicable to only stateful fNS.
 
Figure 9 sNS-initiated Passive Roaming termination
 
 
Step 0:
 
Passive Roaming is enabled between the fNS and the sNS for the End-Device. 
 
Step 1:
 
 When sNS decides to terminate Passive Roaming for the End-Device before the expiration
 of the Passive Roaming lifetime, the sNS SHALL send a PRStopReq message to the fNS
 carrying the DevAddr and DevEUI of the End-Device, and optionally Lifetime. The sNS
 SHALL include Lifetime if the fNS is stateful and the sNS does not wish to receive another
 PRStartReq from the fNS for the End-Device within the stated time span. 
 
 Step 2: 
 
 The fNS SHALL verify that the End-Device with DevEUI is already in Passive Roaming and
 associated with the sNS. If both conditions are satisfied, then the fNS SHALL send 
 PRStopAns message to the sNS carrying Result=Success. Otherwise, the fNS SHALL send 
 PRStopAns message to the sNS carrying Result=UnknownDevEUI. If the received 
 PRStopReq message included Lifetime, then the fNS SHALL not send another PRStartReq 
 to the sNS for the End-Device until the Lifetime expires. 
 
 In case Passive Roaming for the End-Device was previously terminated with a PRStopReq
 message or refused with PRStartAns/Result=Deferred, a new PRStopReq message with a 0 
 value for Lifetime enables NS2 to send again PRStartReq for the End-Device as soon as it 
 receives a packet from that End-Device. This applies only for stateful fNS. 
 
Figure 10 fNS-initiated Passive Roaming termination
 
Step 0:
 
Passive Roaming is enabled between the fNS and the sNS for the End-Device. 
 
Step 1:
 
When the fNS decides to terminate Passive Roaming for the End-Device before the 
expiration of the Passive Roaming lifetime, the fNS SHALL send PRStopReq message to 
the sNS carrying the DevEUI of the End-Device.
 
 Step 2: 
 
 The sNS SHALL verify that the End-Device with DevEUI is served by itself and it is already
 in Passive Roaming with the fNS. If both conditions are satisfied, then the sNS SHALL send 
 PRStopAns message to the fNS carrying Result=Success. Otherwise, the sNS SHALL send 
 PRStopAns message to the fNS carrying Result=UnknownDevEUI.
 
 After the Passive Roaming terminates, the sNS and the fNS SHALL stop forwarding packets 
 towards each other for the designated End-Device.
 
11.4 Handover Roaming 
 
This procedure applies to only R1.1 [LW11] End-Devices and networks.
 
11.4.1 Handover Roaming Start
 
 Figure 11 illustrates the message flow for Handover Roaming Procedure for an ongoing
LoRa Session of an End-Device. Refer to Section 12.1 for Handover Roaming based 
Activation of a new LoRa Session.
 
Figure 11 Handover Roaming start 
 
  Step 0: 
 
 Consider the case the End-Device has performed Activation on the NS1. Therefore, NS1 is 
 acting as the fNS, sNS and hNS for the End-Device. 
 
 Step 1: 
 
The End-Device transmits a Rejoin-request Type 0 message either in response to receiving 
a ForceRejoinReq MAC command (not shown) or autonomously without an external trigger.
 
Step 2:
 
If the NS2 is acting as the sNS for the End-Device as identified by the received DevEUI and
the NS2 has not requested a Rejoin-request Type 0 by sending a ForceRejoinReq, then the 
NS2 SHOULD silently drop the message and the procedure terminates here. 
 
If the NS2 is not the sNS for the End-Device, then the NS2 SHALL lookup its roaming policy
with the operator identified by the NetID in the Rejoin-request. If the NS2 is not configured to 
 
enable Handover Roaming with the identified operator, then the NS2 SHALL discard the
 Rejoin-request and the procedure terminates here. Otherwise, the NS2 SHALL discover the 
 IP address of the NS1 using DNS (see Section 19), if the NS2 is not already configured with 
 the IP address/hostname of the NS1 by an out-of-band mechanism. 
 
 Step 3: 
 
 The NS2 SHALL send an ProfileReq message to the NS1 carrying DevEUI if the NS2 does 
 not have the Device Profile of the End-Device in its cache. Steps 4 and 5 are skipped if the
ProfileReq is not sent.
 
Step 4:
 
The NS1 SHALL lookup its roaming policy with the operator identified by the received NetID. 
 
Step 5:
 
The NS1 SHALL send an ProfileAns to the NS2 carrying Result=Success, Device Profile, 
and Device Profile Timestamp (which carries the timestamp of the last Device Profile 
change) if the NS1 is configured to enable Handover Roaming with the NS2 and for the End- 
Device. If Handover Roaming is not allowed, then the ProfileAns carries 
Result=NoRoamingAgreement or DevRoamingDisallowed, and Lifetime, and the procedure
terminates here. The Lifetime allows the NS1 to request the NS2 not to send additional 
ProfileReq for the End-Device until the Lifetime expires.
 
Step 6:
 
The NS2 SHALL send a HRStartReq message to the NS1 carrying the PHYPayload with
Rejoin-request message, MACVersion, ULMetadata, Device Profile Timestamp, and the 
parameters DevAddr, DLSettings, RxDelay, and optionally CFList identified by the NS2 to be 
assigned to the End-Device. The NS2 SHALL set the value of the MACVersion to the 
highest common version between the End-Device and the NS2. 
 
Step 7:
 
If Handover Roaming is not allowed with the NS2 or for the End-Device, or if the MIC 
verification of the message has failed, then the NS1 SHALL proceed to Step 9 Handover 
Roaming rejection may be due to the per-NS or per-device roaming policy, or potential
unnecessity of Handover Roaming while the End-Device is already being served by another 
sNS. 
 
If the NS1 determines that the Device Profile has changed since the time indicated by the
received Device Profile Timestamp, then the NS1 concludes that the NS2 has a stale Device 
Profile information. In that case, the NS1 SHALL proceed to Step 9
 
Otherwise, the NS1 SHALL forward the RejoinReq message to the JS, carrying the 
PHYPayload with Rejoin-request message, MACVersion, DevEUI, DevAddr, DLSettings,
RxDelay, and CFList as received from the NS2.
 
Step 8:
 
The JS SHALL process the Rejoin-request according to the MACVersion and send a 
RejoinAns message to the NS1 carrying Result=Success, the PHYPayload with Join-accept message, SNwkSIntKey, FNwkSIntKey, NwkSEncKey, Lifetime if the Rejoin-Request is
 accepted by the JS. Otherwise, the JS SHALL send a RejoinAns to the NS1 carrying
 Result=UnknownDevEUI or MICFailed.
 
 The NS1 SHALL treat the received Lifetime value as the upper-bound of the session lifetime
 it assigns to the LoRa session. 
 
 Step 9: 
 
If the NS1 decided not to allow Handover Roaming at Step 7, then the NS1 SHALL send a
HRStartAns message to the NS2 carrying Result set to a failure value (see Table 24), and
Lifetime. The Lifetime allows the NS1 to request the NS2 not to send additional HRStartReq 
for the End-Device until the Lifetime expires. 
 
If the NS1 concluded that the Device Profile known to the NS2 is stale, then the NS1 SHALL
send HRStartAns message to the NS2 carrying Result=StaleDeviceProfile, latest Device
Profile, and its Device Profile Timestamp. The NS2 SHALL jump back to Step 6 to use the 
new Device Profile it just received.
 
Otherwise, the NS1 SHALL forward the payload of the received RejoinAns message in an
HRStartAns message to the NS2 by also including DLMetadata and Service Profile. The 
NS1 SHALL also cache the received SNwkSIntKey, so that it can verify the MIC of the
subsequent Rejoin-Type 0 messages before deciding to forward them to the JS.
 
Step 10:
 
If the HRStartAns message indicates Success, then the NS2 SHALL forward the received 
PHYPayload with Join-accept message to the End-Device. Otherwise, the NS2 SHALL not
send any response back to the End-Device. 
 
If the Rejoin Procedure was successful, then the NS2 SHALL start forwarding packets 
received from the End-Device to the NS1, and the NS1 SHALL accept such packets from 
the NS2. Also, the NS1 SHALL start forwarding packets received from the AS to the NS2,
and the NS2 SHALL accept such packets from the NS1.
 
Step 11:
 
The End-Device sends its first uplink packet. The NS2 SHALL transmit that packet to the 
NS1. 
 
Step 12:
 
The NS2 starts serving as the sNS and the NS1 stops serving as the sNS as soon as the 
first uplink packet is received from the End-Device. Meanwhile, the NS1 continues to serve
as the hNS of the End-Device.
 
11.4.2 Packet Transmission
 
 In case of Handover Roaming, the hNS and the sNS SHALL use XmitDataReq/Ans
 messages the same way they are used with the Passive Roaming (see Section 11.3.2). The
 only difference is, the hNS-sNS interface carries the FRMPayload instead of the 
 PHYPayload, and the ULMetadata/DLMetadata includes different set of objects as described
 in Section 16
 
 11.4.3 Handover Roaming Stop 
 
Figure 12 illustrates the hNS terminating the Handover Roaming with the previously serving 
sNS after the End-Device performs Handover Roaming to a new sNS. 
 
 
Figure 12 Termination of sNS
 
 
Step 0:
 
The End-Device performs Handover Roaming between the NS1 and the NS2. 
 
Step 1:
 
The End-Device performs Handover Roaming between the NS1 and the NS3. 
 
Step 2:
 
The very first uplink packet is received from the End-Device by the NS1 via the new sNS 
(NS3). 
 
Step 3:
 
The NS1 SHALL send an HRStopReq message to the previously serving sNS (NS2)
 carrying DevEUI when it receives the first packet from the End-Device via the new sNS
 (NS3).
 
 HRStopReq message carries optionally Lifetime, which means NS1 does not wish to receive
 another HRStartReq from NS2 for this DevEUI within the stated time span. 
 
 Step 4: 
 
The previously serving sNS (NS2) SHALL terminate Handover Roaming and send an
HRStopAns to the NS1 carrying Result=Success if the NS2 has active Handover Roaming 
for the End-Device identified with the received DevEUI and associated with the NS1. If the 
NS2 does not have an active Handover Roaming for the End-Device associated with the
NS1, then the NS2 SHALL send an HRStopAns to the NS1 carrying
Result=UnknownDevEUI. 
 
Step 5:
 
The NS2 stops serving as the sNS for the LoRa session of the End-Device. If the NS2 has
enabled Passive Roaming with another NS for the LoRa session of the End-Device, then the 
NS2 SHALL also terminate the Passive Roaming with that NS.
 
 In case Handover Roaming for the End-Device was previously terminated with a HRStopReq
 command, a new HRStopReq command with a 0 value for Lifetime enables NS2 to send again 
 HRStart requests for this End-Device as soon as it receives a new Rejoin-request Type 0
 message.
 
Another case of Handover Roaming termination is when the sNS decides to terminate 
roaming. The sNS may precede the termination procedure by sending a ForceRejoinReq
command to the End-Device. Then, the sNS SHALL send an HRStopReq to the hNS
carrying the DevEUI. The hNS SHALL terminate Handover Roaming and send an
HRStopAns to the sNS carrying Result=Success if the hNS has active Handover Roaming 
for the End-Device identified with the received DevEUI and associated with the sNS. If the 
hNS does not have an active Handover Roaming for the End-Device associated with the
sNS, then the hNS SHALL send an HRStopAns to the sNS carrying
Result=UnknownDevEUI. The sNS may still terminate the Handover Roaming even if it
received a failure Result from the hNS. 
 
 
11.4.4 Home NS Regaining Control 
 
Figure 13 illustrates the message flow of the hNS becoming the sNS by taking the control
from currently serving sNS.
 
Figure 13 hNS regaining sNS control 
 
 
 Step 0: 
 
 The End-Device performs Handover Roaming between the NS1 and the NS2.
 
 Step 1: 
 
The NS1 decides to become the sNS. 
 
Step 2:
 
The NS1 SHALL send an HRStartReq message to the NS1 carrying DevEUI to trigger the 
Handover Roaming.
 
Step 3:
 
The NS2 SHALL send HRStartAns to the NS1 carrying Result=Success if the NS2 has
active Handover Roaming for the End-Device identified by the received DevEUI and
associated with the NS1, Result=UnknownDevEUI otherwise.
 
Step 4:
 
The NS2 SHALL initiate network-triggered Handover Roaming as described in Section 
11.4.1. It is assumed that the End-Device is within the radio coverage of the NS1 when this 
procedure is initiated, and the NS1 rejects Handover Roaming attempt from other NSs, 
including NS2, and becomes the sNS.
 
Step 5:
 
The very first uplink packet is received from the End-Device directly by the NS1. 
 
 Step 6: 
 
 The NS1 SHALL perform Handover Roaming Stop Procedure with the NS2 as described in 
 Section 11.4.3. 
 
 Step 7: 
 
The NS2 stops serving as the sNS for the LoRa Session of the End-Device. If the NS2 has
enabled Passive Roaming with another NS for the LoRa session of the End-Device, then the 
NS2 SHALL also terminate the Passive Roaming with that NS.
 
Alternatively, the NS1 can wait until the End-Device decides to initiate Handover Roaming 
on its own, effectively skipping the Steps 2 and 3, and continuing with the Steps 4-7.
 
12 OTA Roaming Activation Procedure
 
 This section describes the procedures for activation of a new LoRa Session when the End-
 Device is outside the coverage of its Home NS but under the coverage of a Visited NS.
 
 It is assumed that the Home NS is aware of the roaming capabilities of the Visited NS, and 
 the Home NS decides which type of activation (Passive Roaming or Handover Roaming
 based) will be performed. 
 
 
 12.1 Handover Roaming Activation 
 
This procedure applies to both R1.0 [LW10, LW102] and R1.1 [LW11] End-Devices and 
networks. 
 
12.1.1 Handover Roaming Start
 
Figure 14 illustrates the message flow for OTA Handover Roaming Activation Procedure.

Figure 14 Message flow for Handover Roaming Activation Procedure.
 
 
 Step 1: 
 
 The End-Device SHALL transmit a Join-request message.
 
 Step 2: 
 
 When the NS2 receives the Join-request message, the NS2 SHALL determine whether it is 
the Home NS for the End-Device identified by DevEUI, or not. In this flow, it is assumed that
the NS2 is not the Home NS of the End-Device. See Section 8 for the other case. 
 
The NS2 SHALL determine whether it is configured to work with the JS identified by the
JoinEUI or not. If it is not configured so, then the NS2 SHALL terminate the procedure here. 
 
The NS2 SHALL use DNS to lookup the IP address of the JS based on the JoinEUI in the 
received Join-request message (see Section 19), if the NS2 is not already configured with
the IP address/hostname of the JS by an out-of-band mechanism. If DNS lookup fails, then 
the NS2 SHALL terminate the procedure here. 
 
Step 3:
 
If the NS2 already knows the identity of the Home NS of the End-Device, then Steps 3 and 4 
are skipped. Otherwise, the NS2 SHALL send an HomeNSReq message to the JS carrying
the DevEUI of the Join-request message.
 
Step 4:
 
The JS SHALL send an HomeNSAns message to the NS2 carrying 
Result=NoRoamingAgreement if the NS2 is not in the authorized networks as listed in the JS 
to serve the End-Device for Roaming Activation, and the procedure terminates here.
 
The JS SHALL send HomeNSAns message to the NS2 carrying Result=Success and
HNetID of the End-Device (NetID of NS1). 
 
Step 5:
 
If the NS2 already knows the Device Profile of the End-Device, and NS2 only has Handover
Roaming agreement with NS1, then Steps 5 and 6 are skipped. Otherwise, the NS2 SHALL 
use DNS to lookup the IP address of the NS1 based on the NetID in the received Join-
request message (see Section 19), if the NS2 is not already configured with the IP 
address/hostname of the NS1 by an out-of-band mechanism. If DNS lookup fails, then the
NS2 SHALL terminate the procedure here.
 
The NS2 SHALL send a ProfileReq message to the NS1 carrying the DevEUI. 
 
Step 6:
 
If there is no business agreement between the NS1 and the NS2, then the NS1 SHALL send 
an ProfileAns message to the NS2 carrying Result=NoRoamingAgreement. If the NS1 could
not identify the End-Device with the DevEUI, then the NS1 SHALL send a ProfileAns
message to the NS2 carrying Result=UnknownDevEUI. If the End-Device is not allowed to 
perform Roaming Activation, then the NS1 SHALL send a ProfileAns message to the NS2
 
carrying Result=RoamingActDisallowed. Otherwise, assuming the NS1 decides to enable
 Handover Roaming Activation, the NS1 SHALL send a ProfileAns message to the NS2
 carrying Result=Success, RoamingActivationType=Handover, Device Profile, and Device
 Profile Timestamp (which carries the timestamp of the last Device Profile change). 
 
 The following steps describe the procedure when the RoamingActivationType is Handover.
 
 Step 7: 
 
If the Result of incoming ProfileAns indicates Success, or if the Steps 5 and 6 are skipped, 
then the NS2 SHALL send an HRStartReq message to the NS1 carrying the PHYPayload
with Join-Request message, MACVersion, ULMetadata, DevAddr, DLSettings, RxDelay,
optionally CFList, and Device Profile Timestamp. The NS2 SHALL set the value of the
MACVersion to the highest common version between the End-Device and the NS2.
 
Step 8:
 
When steps 5 and 6 are skipped, if there is no business agreement between the NS1 and 
the NS2 or if the NS1 could not identify the End-Device with the DevEUI or if the End-Device
is not allowed to perform Roaming Activation then the NS1 shall proceed to Step 10 
 
If the NS1 determines that the Device Profile has changed since the time indicated by the
received Device Profile Timestamp, then the NS1 concludes that the NS2 has a stale Device 
Profile information. In that case, the NS1 SHALL proceed to Step 10 Otherwise, the NS1 
sends a JoinReq message to the JS carrying the PHYPayload with Join-request message, 
MACVersion, DevEUI, DevAddr, DLSettings, RxDelay, and CFList as received from the 
NS2. 
 
Step 9:
 
The JS SHALL process the Join-request message according to the MACVersion and send 
JoinAns to the NS1 carrying Result=Success, PHYPayload with Join-accept message,
network session keys (SNwkSIntKey, FNwkSIntKey, and NwkSEncKey in case of a R1.1,
and NwkSKey in case of a R1.0/1.0.2 End-Device), encrypted AppSKey or SessionKeyID or 
both, Lifetime in case of success, and Result=UnknownDevEUI or MICFailed in case of 
failure (e.g., if the End-Device is not recognized by the JS, or if the MIC of the Join-request
fails the verification). Network session keys, and AppSKey are generated based on the 
LoRaWAN specification [LW10, LW11]. AppSKey is encrypted using a key shared between
the JS and the AS when it is delivered from the JS to the NS. 
 
Step 10:
 
If there is no business agreement between the NS1 and the NS2, then the NS1 SHALL send 
an HRStartAns message to the NS2 carrying Result=NoRoamingAgreement. If the NS1 
could not identify the End-Device with the DevEUI, then the NS1 SHALL send a HRStartAns 
message to the NS2 carrying Result=UnknownDevEUI. If the End-Device is not allowed to 
perform Roaming Activation, then the NS1 SHALL send a HRStartAns message to the NS2
carrying Result= RoamingActDisallowed. 
 
If the NS1 concluded that the Device Profile known to the NS2 is stale, then the NS1 SHALL
send HRStartAns message to the NS2 carrying Result=StaleDeviceProfile, latest Device
Profile, and its Device Profile Timestamp. In this case, the NS2 SHALL jump back to Step 7 
to use the new Device Profile it just received. 

 Otherwise, the NS1 SHALL send an HRStartAns message to the NS2. The HRStartAns
 SHALL contain the same objects as the JoinAns message described in Step 9 and also the 
 Service Profile of the End-Device.
 
 In case of a R1.1 End-Device, the NS1 SHALL also cache the received SNwkSIntKey, so
 that it can verify the MIC of the subsequent Rejoin-Type 0 messages before deciding to
 forward them to the JS.
 
Step 11:
 
The NS2 SHALL forward the received PHYPayload with Join-accept message to the End- 
Device if HRStartAns message indicates success. The End-Device SHALL generate
network session keys, and AppSKey based on the LoRaWAN specification [LW10, LW11]
upon receiving the Join-accept message. 
 
If encrypted AppSKey is not made available by the JS to the AS via the NS, then the AS 
SHALL retrieve it directly from the JS using the same method as defined in Step 8 of OTA
Activation at Home Procedure (see Section 8). 
 
12.1.2 Packet Transmission 
 
The details of uplink and downlink packet transmission between the hNS and the sNS after 
the two are engaged in Roaming Activation for an End-Device are same as the Handover 
Roaming case as described in Section 11.4.2. 
 
12.1.3 Handover Roaming Stop
 
 Handover Roaming Stop Procedure (Section 11.4.3) is used when either the hNS or the sNS
 decides to terminate the roaming.
 
 
 12.2 Passive Roaming Activation 
 
This procedure applies to both R1.0 [LW10, LW102] and R1.1 [LW11] End-Devices and 
networks. 
 
 
12.2.1 Passive Roaming Start
 
Figure 15 illustrates the message flow for OTA Passive Roaming Activation Procedure.
 
Figure 15 Message flow for Passive Roaming Activation Procedure. 
 
 
 Step 1: 
 
 The End-Device SHALL transmit a Join-request message.
 
 Step 2: 
 
When the NS2 receives the Join-request message, the NS2 SHALL determine whether it is
the Home NS for the End-Device identified by DevEUI, or not. In this flow, it is assumed that
the NS2 is not the Home NS of the End-Device. See Section 8 for the other case. 
 
The NS2 SHALL determine whether it is configured to work with the JS identified by the
JoinEUI or not. If it is not configured so, then the NS2 SHALL terminate the procedure here. 
 
The NS2 SHALL use DNS to lookup the IP address of the JS based on the JoinEUI in the 
received Join-request message (see Section 19), if the NS2 is not already configured with
the IP address/hostname of the JS by an out-of-band mechanism. If DNS lookup fails, then 
the NS2 SHALL terminate the procedure here. 
 
Step 3:
 
If the NS2 already knows the identity of the Home NS of the End-Device, then Steps 3 and 4
 are skipped. Otherwise, the NS2 SHALL send an HomeNSReq message to the JS carrying 
 the DevEUI of the Join-request message. 
 
 Step 4: 
 
 The JS SHALL send an HomeNSAns message to the NS2 carrying
 Result=NoRoamingAgreement if the NS2 is not in the authorized networks as listed in the JS
 to serve the End-Device for Passive Roaming Activation, and the procedure terminates here.
 
The JS SHALL send HomeNSAns message to the NS2 carrying Result=Success and hNS 
of the End-Device (NetID of NS1).
 
Step 5:
 
If the NS2 only has Passive Roaming agreement with NS1, then Steps 5 and 6 are skipped. 
Otherwise, the NS2 SHALL use DNS to lookup the IP address of the NS1 based on the 
NetID received from the JS, if the NS2 is not already configured with the IP 
address/hostname of the NS1 by an out-of-band mechanism. If DNS lookup fails, then the
NS2 SHALL terminate the procedure here.
 
The NS2 SHALL send a ProfileReq message to the NS1 carrying the DevEUI. 
 
Step 6:
 
If there is no business agreement between the NS1 and the NS2, then the NS1 SHALL send 
an ProfileAns message to the NS2 carrying Result=NoRoamingAgreement. If the NS1 could
not identify the End-Device with the DevEUI, then the NS1 SHALL send a ProfileAns
message to the NS2 carrying Result=UnknownDevEUI. If the End-Device is not allowed to 
perform Roaming Activation, then the NS1 SHALL send a ProfileAns message to the NS2
carrying Result=RoamingActDisallowed. Otherwise, assuming the NS1 decides to enable 
Passive Roaming Activation, the NS1 SHALL send a ProfileAns message to the NS2 
carrying Result=Success, RoamingActivationType. 
 
The following describes the behavior when the RoamingActivationType is Passive.
 
Step 7:
 
If the Result of incoming ProfileAns indicates Success, or if the Steps 5 and 6 were skipped, 
then the NS2 SHALL send an PRStartReq message to the NS1 carrying the PHYPayload
with Join-Request message ULMetadata.
 
Step 8:
 
When steps 5 and 6 are skipped, if there is no business agreement between the NS1 and 
the NS2, or if the NS1 could not identify the End-Device with the DevEUI, or if the End-
Device is not allowed to perform Roaming Activation, or if the NS1 does not wish to enable 
Passive Roaming activation via NS2 then the NS1 shall proceed to step 10 
 
Otherwise, The NS1 SHALL send a JoinReq message to the JS carrying the PHYPayload
with Join-request message, DevEUI, DevAddr, DLSettings, RxDelay, and optionally CFList
defined by the NS1.

 Step 9: 
 
 The JS processes the Join-request message and sends JoinAns to the NS1 carrying
 Result=Success, PHYPayload with Join-accept message, network session keys 
 (SNwkSIntKey, FNwkSIntKey, and NwkSEncKey in case of a R1.1, and NwkSKey in case of 
 a R1.0/1.0.2 End-Device), encrypted AppSKey or SessionKeyID or both, Lifetime in case of
 success, and Result=UnknownDevEUI or MICFailed in case of failure (e.g., if the End-
 Device is not recognized by the JS, or if the MIC of the Join-request fails the verification).
 Network session keys, and AppSKey are generated based on the LoRaWAN specification 
[LW10, LW102, LW11]. AppSKey is encrypted using a key shared between the JS and the 
AS when it is delivered from the JS to the NS. 
 
Step 10:
 
If there is no business agreement between the NS1 and the NS2, then the NS1 SHALL send 
an PRStartAns message to the NS2 carrying Result=NoRoamingAgreement. If the NS1 
could not identify the End-Device with the DevEUI, then the NS1 SHALL send a PRStartAns 
message to the NS2 carrying Result=UnknownDevEUI. If the End-Device is not allowed to 
perform Roaming Activation, then the NS1 SHALL send a PRStartAns message to the NS2
carrying Result= RoamingActDisallowed. If the NS1 does not wish to enable Passive
Roaming activation via NS2, then it SHALL send a PRStartAns to the NS2 carrying
Result=Deferred, and Lifetime. The NS2 SHALL not send any more PRStartReq to the NS1
for the same End-Device for the duration of Lifetime upon receiving this message. 
 
Otherwise, the NS1 SHALL send a PRStartAns to the NS2 carrying the Result=Success, 
PHYPayload with Join-accept message , and Lifetime associated with the Passive Roaming.
The NS1 SHALL also include DevEUI and ServiceProfile if NS2 is operating as a stateful 
fNS, and, FCntUp and FNwkSIntKey (in case of R1.1) or NwkSKey (in case of R1.0/1.0.2) in
the PRStartAns message if NS1-NS2 Passive Roaming agreement requires the NS2 to
perform MIC check on the uplink packets. 
 
Step 11:
 
The NS2 SHALL forward the received PHYPayload with Join-accept message to the End- 
Device if PRStartAns message indicates success. The End-Device SHALL generate network 
session keys, and AppSKey based on the LoRaWAN specification [LW10, LW102, LW11]
upon receiving the Join-accept message. 
 
If encrypted AppSKey is not made available by the JS to the AS via the NS, then the AS 
SHALL retrieve it directly from the JS using the same method as defined in Step 8 of OTA
Activation at Home Procedure (see Section 8). 
 
When the procedure completes successfully, the NS2 becomes the fNS, and the NS1 
becomes the sNS (in addition to being the hNS) of the newly created LoRa Session. 
 
12.2.1 Packet Transmission
 
 The details of uplink and downlink packet transmission between the sNS and the fNS after
 the two are engaged in Passive Roaming Activation for an End-Device are same as the
 Passive Roaming case as described in Section 11.3.2. 
 
 
 12.2.2 Passive Roaming Stop 
 
 Passive Roaming Stop Procedure (Section 11.3.3) is used when either the sNS or the fNS
decides to terminate the roaming. 
 
 
 13 DevAddr Assignment
 
 NetID is a 24bit network identifier assigned to LoRaWAN networks by the LoRa Alliance. 
 Values 0x000000 and 0x000001 are reserved for experimental networks and networks that 
 are not using roaming. These values can be used by any network without getting permission
 from the LoRa Alliance. LoRaWAN networks that use roaming need to obtain a unique NetID
 value assigned by the LoRa Alliance. 

Figure 16 NetID format 
 
 
Figure 16 illustrates the format of the NetID which is composed of the following fields: 
 
Type: The 3 MSB (Most Significant Bits) of the NetID indicates the NetID Type (0 
through 7).
 
ID: Variable length LSB (Least Significant Bits) of NetID as assigned by the LoRa
Alliance. Length of the ID field depends on the Type of the NetID. 
 
RFU: If there are any unused bits in the NetID after the Type and ID fields are 
consumed, they are marked as RFU and set to zero. These RFU bits are placed in
between the Type and ID bits, if those fields do not already consume the 24 bits of 
the NetID.
 
Table 2 provides the details on the Type field setting, number of RFU bits, and length of the
ID field for each NetID Type.
 
Table 2 NetID Types
 
 
For example, the NetID value 0x000003 is a Type 0 NetID with ID=3, and value 0x6000FF is 
a Type 3 NetID with ID=255.

Figure 17 DevAddr format 
 
 
 DevAddr is an End-Device identifier assigned by the LoRaWAN network. Figure 17 
 illustrates the format of the DevAddr which is composed of the following fields:
 
 Type Prefix: Variable length MSB that indicates the NetID Type of the assigning
 network.
 
NwkID: Variable length bits that follow the Type Prefix field. They are used for
identifying the network. The value of NwkID is set to the predefined number of LSB of
ID field of the NetID. 
 
NwkAddr: Variable length LSB that is assigned to the End-Device by the network. 
 
Table 3 provides the details on the length and setting of Type Prefix field, size of NwkID and
NwkAddr fields for each Type of NetID. The NS shall use the parameters defined in this
table when assigning a DevAddr to its End-Devices based on its NetID.
 
 
Table 3 DevAddr format based on the NetID Type 
 
 
When number of NwkID bits is less than the number of bits in the ID field of the NetID (as in 
Types 3 through 7), that means multiple NetIDs are likely to map to the same NwkID value. 
Section 11.3 Passive Roaming describes how the fNS tries multiple NSs to find the sNS of
the End-Device.
 
 
14 Periodic Recovery
 
 Rejoin-request Type 1 message is defined for restoring connectivity with an End-Device in
 case of complete state loss on the sNS. The message is sent by the End-Device periodically 
 for giving the sNS a chance to recover. 
 
 When an NS receives a Rejoin-request Type 1, the NS SHALL determine if it has a valid
 LoRa Session with the End-Device as identified by the received DevEUI. If the NS is not 
 acting as the sNS for the End-Device, then the NS SHALL treat the incoming Rejoin-request
Type 1 exactly same way as it would process a Join-request (i.e., following Activation at 
Home or Roaming Activation Procedures by transporting Rejoin-request message instead of 
the Join-request message from the NS to the JS). If the NS is acting as the sNS for the End-
Device, then the NS SHALL behave as described in Section 6.2.4.4 of [LW11]. 
 
This procedure applies to only R1.1 [LW11] End-Devices and networks.
 
 
15 Rekeying and DevAddr Reassignment
 
 If the sNS decides to either refresh the session keys, reset the frame counters, or assign a
 new DevAddr to the End-Device without changing the channel definitions, the sNS SHALL
 send a ForceRejoinReq with RejoinType 2 MAC command to the End-Device.
 
 The End-Device SHALL send a Rejoin-request Type 2 message when it receives a
 ForceRejoinReq from the sNS. 
 
The End-Device SHALL not send a Rejoin-request Type 2 message unless it receives a
valid ForceRejoinReq with RejoinType 2 from its sNS. The sNS SHALL discard a received
Rejoin-request Type 2 if the sNS has not sent a ForceRejoinReq with RejoinType 2 MAC 
command to the End-Device.
 
Processing of the Rejoin-request Type 2 message is same as processing of Rejoin-request 
Type 0 as described in Section 11.4.1 Handover Roaming Start, considering the receiving 
NS (NS2 in Figure 11) is already the sNS. 
 
If the End-Device decides to refresh the session keys or reset the frame counters without 
receiving a ForceRejoinReq with RejoinType 2 MAC command from the sNS, then the End-
Device SHALL send a Join-request. 
 
This procedure applies to only R1.1 [LW11] End-Devices and networks.
 
16 Packet Metadata
 
16.1 UL Packet Metadata
 
Each uplink packet received by the LoRa system is associated with a set of parameters 
obtained from the radio receiver and the local context of the LoRa Session of the End-
Device. Such parameters are shared among communicating network elements in the form of 
metadata along with the packet payload in order to assist uplink transmission. Table 4
illustrates the metadata details for the uplink packets.

Device. Such parameters are shared among communicating network elements in the form of 
metadata along with the packet payload in order to assist the downlink transmission. Table 5 
illustrates the metadata details for downlink packets.

18 Usage Data Records 
 
18.1 Network Activation Record
 
Network Activation Record is used for keeping track of the End-Devices performing Roaming 
Activation. When the Roaming Activation Procedure takes place, then the NS SHALL
generate a monthly Network Activation Record for each ServiceProfileID of another NS that 
has at least one End-Device active throughout the month, and dedicated Network Activation 
Records for each activation and deactivation of an End-Device from another NS. Table 9

19 JoinEUI and NetID Resolution
 
 A Network Server SHALL resolve the value of JoinEUI to the IP address and port number of
 the Join Server when it receives this value either in a Join-request or a Rejoin-request
 message. Similarly, NetID value SHALL be resolved to the IP address and port number of
 the associated Network Server when it is received by a Network Server in a Rejoin-request
 message.
 
 Both types of address resolutions are carried out by using DNS. The solution mechanism is
inspired by the SIP: Locating SIP Servers, RFC 3263, and supports resolution of a single
identifier to multiple alternative IP addresses and port numbers in order to support high
availability and geo-redundancy. 
 
It should be noted that some organizations need to operate Join Servers without operating a 
network, therefore the Join Server resolution mechanism needs to work without the need to
allocate a NetID. 
 
19.1 DNS configuration 
 
The LoRa Alliance SHALL establish and operate two dedicated subdomains to resolve Join 
Servers and NetIDs, rooted at JOINEUIS.LORA-ALLIANCE.ORG and NETIDS.LORA-
ALLIANCE.ORG, respectively.
 
A 24-bit NetID is represented as a name in the NETIDS.LORA-ALLIANCE.ORG domain by a
sequence of nibbles with the suffix .NETIDS.LORA-ALLIANCE.ORG. The high-order nibble
is encoded first, followed by the next higher-order nibble and so on. Each nibble is 
represented by a hexadecimal digit.For example, the domain name corresponding to the
NetID 
 
 1290 (0x00050A) 
 
would be
 
 00050a.NETIDS.LORA-ALLIANCE.ORG
 
 
A Join EUI (IEEE EUI-64) is represented as a name in the JOINEUIS.LORA- 
ALLIANCE.ORG domain by a sequence of nibbles separated by dots with the suffix 
.JOINEUIS.LORA-ALLIANCE.ORG. The sequence of nibbles is encoded in reverse order,
i.e., the low-order nibble is encoded first, followed by the next low-order nibble and so on.
Each nibble is represented by a hexadecimal digit. For example, the domain name 
corresponding to the EUI
 
 00-00-5E-10-00-00-00-2F
 
would be
 
 f.2.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.e.5.0.0.0.0.JOINEUIS.LORA-ALLIANCE.ORG
 
 
The NAPTRs SHALL point to replacement servers according to order, preference, and flags, 
and service parameters provided by the operators. 
 
 
For example: 
 orderprefflagsservice regexpreplacement 
 IN NAPTR5050S LWN _LWN._X2H.operator.com. 
 IN NAPTR9050S LWNS_LWN._J2H.operator.com
 IN NAPTR100 50S LWN _LWN._B2H.operator.com.
 
 Lower values of order field have higher precedence. For same order values, lower values 
 of pref field have higher precedence. Same priority records in the lexicographic order of 
 <order>/<pref> SHALL be load balanced.
 
The NAPTR record service describes the service provided by the server, as well as the 
transport protocol that may be used to access it. LWN denotes a LoRaWAN Server (either 
Join Server or a Network Server) using HTTP, and LWNS denotes a server using HTTPS. 
 
There are currently four possible flags. S denotes that an SRV lookup is to be performed
on the output of this NAPTR record. A means the result should be looked up as an A,
AAAA or A6 record. A U means that the NAPTR result is an absolute URI that the 
application should process. A P would signify a non-terminal rule where additional
NAPTR lookups would be necessary. 
 
Each NAPTR records can be used to transform the domain value for the next resolution 
step. 
 
When flag S is used, the next resolution step will lookup an SRV record, as defined in RFC
2782, as in the example below. Operator SHALL include corresponding SRV records in its
own DNS.
 
 Priority WeightPortTarget 
 INSRV 0 1 443 server1.operator.com
 INSRV 0 2 443 server2.operator.com
 
It is not necessary for the domain suffixes in the NAPTR replacement field to match the
domain of the original query (i.e., operator.com above).
 
19.2 NetID Resolution 
 
The input parameter is the 24-bit NetID as carried in the Rejoin-request message sent by the
End-Device to the Network Server of the Visited Network. 
 
The Visited Network Server SHALL perform a DNS query for NAPTR records using the
mapping for NetIDs described in Section 19.1. The Network Server performing the query 
SHALL eliminate results with transport and encoding protocols that are not supported by the
server itself.
 
Network Server SHALL perform DNS recursively until the IP address and port number of the 
Home Network Server is resolved. 
 
19.3 JoinEUI Resolution
 
 The input parameter is the 64-bit JoinEUI as carried in the Join-request message sent by the 
 End-Device to the Network Server of the Home Network or the Rejoin-request message sent 
 by the End-Device to the Network Server of the Visited Network.
 
 The receiving Network Server SHALL perform a DNS query for NAPTR records using the 
 mapping for JoinEUIs described in Section 19.1. The Network Server performing the query
 SHALL eliminate results with transport and encoding protocols that are not supported by the 
server itself.
 
Network Server SHALL perform DNS recursively until the IP address and the port number of 
the Join Server is resolved. 
 
 
20 Transport Layer
 
 The LoRaWAN backend interfaces involve interconnection among the network elements, 
 such as the JS, the NS, and the AS for delivering control signals and data packets. The
 following network interfaces are in scope of the current specification: 
 
 -AS-JS (optional) 
 -JS-NS
 -NS-NS
A JoinEUI identifies a JS, whereas an NS is identified by its NetID. Multiple JoinEUIs may
identify the same JS. Both the JoinEUI and the NetID can be resolved into the IP address 
and port number of the respective servers by using DNS.
 
Network elements SHALL rely on a security solution that can provide mutual end-point 
authentication, integrity and replay protection, and confidentiality when communicating with
each other. The choice of mechanism used for achieving these properties is left to the 
deployments (e.g., using IPsec VPN, HTTPS, physical security, etc.) 
 
Network element SHALL use HTTP 1.1 [RFC2616] and encode the payloads using JSON. 
In order to support sending messages (signal or data) in both directions, a pair of HTTP
connections needs to be setup between the two end-points. Each end-point SHALL initiate 
and maintain an HTTP connection with the other end-point. HTTP end-points SHOULD use 
persistent connections.
 
 
21 Key Transport Security 
 
 Several times during a LoRa Session, keys need to be exchanged between servers (on JS-
 AS, JS-NS or NS-NS interfaces for instance).
 
 To secure the transport of those keys, Key Encryption Keys (KEK) can be used to encrypt 
 them, following the wrapping process defined in the RFC 3394 
 
 Ontopofthat,eachKeyEncryptionKeyisassociatedwithaKeyEncryptionKeyLabel
(KEKLabel) and a wrapping algorithm as defined in the RFC3394 to allow selecting the right 
key and the right algorithm during the unwrapping operation. 
 
The set of KEK, associated KEKLabels, and algorithm are generated and exchanged between 
the servers during an offline process that is not part of this specification, servers being of 2 
kind: the key requester and the key sender.
 
The decision to wrap or not a key SHALL always be taken by the entity who is in charge of
delivering the key (i.e., key sender).
 
Table 11 provides the details of the KeyEnvelope Object that is used for wrapping keys. 
 
 Information element M/O Description/notes 
 KEKLabelO

This label identifies the key to be used to unwrap the
AESKey. If this value is not present, it means the
AESKey is transmitted in clear. 
 AESKeyM

AESKey carries the RFC3394-wrapped key if the
KEKLabel field is present. If the KEKLabel field is not
present, then the AESKey carries the key in clear. 
 
 Table 11 KeyEnvelope Object 
 
 
22 Messages and Payloads 
 
 22.1 Encoding 
 
 HTTP is used as the transport layer for sending the backend request and answer messages
 (e.g., JoinReq and JoinAns). Following interfaces carry both the backend request and 
 answer messages over HTTP Requests while using HTTP Responses simply for
 acknowledging the delivery: fNS-sNS, sNS-hNS. Following interfaces carry the backend 
 request messages over HTTP Requests, whereas the backend answer messages may be 
 carried over either the HTTP Response or a subsequent HTTP Request: hNS-JS, vNS-JS,
AS-JS.The method used by the JS for each backend peer is determined out-of-band. 
 
Network elements SHALL use JSON data format for sending request and answer
messages. When a network element has a message to send to another network element in 
HTTP Request, it SHALL generate an HTTP POST Request for Target URL. Target URL is 
a configuration parameter that is agreed upon between the two network elements interfacing 
with each other. For example, on a given NS, the Target URL for a JS can be 
https://js.lora_operator.com. 
 
HTTP carries the request and answer messages as a JSON-encoded payload with various 
objects. Names of the objects that need to be included in a given request or answer
message are provided in the sections that describe the detailed message flows. Encoding of
each object type is provided in Section 22.3. Each message SHALL include a 
ProtocolVersion object whose value is set to 1.0 by the implementations of this 
specification, MessageType object that defines the action required for that message, and
SenderID and ReceiverID objects. The sender of the message SHALL set the SenderID to
the NetID, JoinEUI, or AS-ID of the sender, depending on whether the sender is an NS or JS
or an AS, respectively. Similarly, the sender of the message SHALL set the ReceiverID to 
the NetID, JoinEUI, or AS-ID of the intended receiver, depending on whether the receiver is 
an NS or JS or an AS, respectively.
 
In order for a network element to be able to match a received answer message with the 
pending request message a TransactionID is used. The sender of a request message 
SHALL include a TransactionID in the message whose value setting is at the discretion of 
the sender. The sender of an answer message SHALL include the same TransactionID that
was recevied in the request message that triggered the answer message. If a network
element receives an answer message for which there is no pending request with the
TransactionID value, then it SHALL discard the received message. 
 
If the ProtocolVersion of the received message is not set to 1.0, then the receiving network
element SHALL return a message carrying Result=InvalidProtocolVersion. If the SenderID or 
the ReceiverID of the received message is unknown to the receiving network element, then
it SHALL return a message carrying Result=UnknownSender or UnknownReceiver. 
 
A network element MAY include SenderToken in its messages if it expects the target
network element to echo the same value in ReceiverToken for each subsequent messages 
that are associated with the same End-Device. The sNS SHALL NOT send a SenderToken
when communicating with a stateless fNS, as the fNS cannot store that token. A network 
element SHALL include a ReceiverToken in its messages if it received a SenderToken from
the target network element for the same End-Device. In that case the network element
SHALL copy the value of the received SenderToken to the transmitted ReceiverToken.
 
 
 Figure 18 and Figure 19 illustrate two variants of the HTTP message flow for OTA Activation 
 at Home Procedure as an example. While these figures are showing the HTTP details, rest
 of the figures in this document only illustrate the backend messages (e.g., not showing 
 HTTP Responses unless they carry a backend message as a payload).

22.2 Backend Message Types 
 
 Table 12 provides the list of backend message types in pairs.
 
 
Table 12 Backend message types 
 
 
 Table 13 provides the list of payload objects carried by each backend message. If a
discrepancy ever occurs between the Table 13 and the description of the associated 
procedures, the latter one takes precedence.
 
Table 13 Messages and payloads
 
 
 The following notations are used in Table 13: 
 
M: Mandatory 
 O : Optional
 Ms : Mandatory, when Result=Success
 Mf : Mandatory, when Result=Failure
 Os : Optional, when Result=Success
 Of : Optional, when Result=Failure

 MX : Mandatory to include exactly one of the 2 (groups of) objects marked with the 
 same value X. When shown as MXY, objects marked with the same value Y are
 considered as a group. 

An empty cell indicates the object is never used with the designated message. 
 
 
22.3 Data Types 
 
Table 14 provides the JSON object details for various message payloads defined in this
specification. When an object defined in this specification corresponds to a parameter
defined in the LoRaWAN specification (e.g., DevEUI, SNwkSIntKey, etc.), then the 
parameter details in that specification also apply to the corresponding object value in this
specification (e.g., DevEUI is 64 bits, SNwkSIntKey is 128 bits, etc.). 
 
The object named VSExtension (Vendor-Specific Extension) allows carrying proprietary 
objects between the servers as needed in specific deployment scenarios. Definition of its 
content is left to specific implementations. The server SHALL process a received
VSExtension Object if it is recognized by the server, and discard it otherwise.
