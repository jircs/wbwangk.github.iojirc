Serialized TID Numbers –A Headache or a Blessing for RFID Crackers?

Abstract—Though transponder ID (TID) numbers of RFID tags were originally introduced to identify the chip model, serialized TID numbers are currently advertised as security features of UHF chips. Serialized TID numbers do not provide any cryptographic protection, but they do introduce a practical hurdle against adversaries who want to clone RFID tags today. Furthermore, serialized TID numbers are important for endusers who want to protect their current UHF tags from cloning since cryptographic tags are not yet commercially available in that frequency range. In this overview paper, we analyze the suitability of serialized TID numbers for security applications by evaluating the effort to bypass the TID check based on known vulnerabilities and we compare this effort to the needed level of protection in an example of anti-counterfeiting in the tobacco industry. The analysis illustrates that the practical hurdle of TID checks is not high enough for industrial-scale security applications and that it can completely diminish due to commodification of the RFID technology. However, end-users of security applications can still benefit from the increased tag cloning resistance that serialized TID numbers provide before migrating to more secure solutions.

I. INTRODUCTION

Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags store Transponder ID (TID) numbers that identify the chip’s model and manufacturer. These numbers are written on the chips during fabrication and they are protected against rewriting. A TID number can optionally include a serial part that identifies also the unique chip. These serialized TID numbers are written on some existing EPC Class-1 Generation-2 (in short: Gen-2) chips and they are expected to become a common feature of Gen-2 chips in the future. 

On the one hand, serialized TID numbers can be a big headache for RFID crackers who want to clone tags. While a tag’s object ID number, such as the Electronic Product Code (EPC), can be easily changed, changing the writeprotected TID number is considerably harder. As a result, chip manufacturers advertise the serialized TID numbers as security features of Gen-2 chips. On the other hand, the use of serialized TID numbers as security features represents a big opportunity for RFID crackers. In contrast to cryptographic tags, serialized TID numbers do not provide any real security against tag cloning. For instance, there is nothing that prevents an adversary from reading the serialized TID number of a tag and transmitting this number to a reader to impersonate the tag. In addition, if chips with programmable TID numbers became commercially available, cloning serialized TID numbers would become as easy as cloning EPC numbers. 

Despite these obvious vulnerabilities of the TID scheme, it would nevertheless be incorrect to claim that serialized TID numbers do not provide any protection against tag cloning and impersonation; since RFID tags with programmable TID numbers are not available in the market today, it is currently not easy for an adversary to obtain a passive RFID tag with a wanted serialized TID number. Because of this dilemma, endusers have a reason to be confused about the usefulness of serialized TID numbers in security applications such as access control, ticketing and anti-counterfeiting. In addition, there are dangerous misconceptions about the level of protection that serialized TID numbers can provide. For instance, the United States Department of Homeland Security posits in its Privacy Impact Assessment on the Passport Card [1] that ”...there is a powerful tool that can be used to remove the risk of cloning. This tool is the Tag Identifier, or TID. The TID is available on all Gen 2 RFID tags” [2]. First, given the aforementioned vulnerabilities, it is hardly appropriate to call TID a powerful tool, at least in the long term. Second, as our survey of major Gen-2 chip manufacturers shows, only some Gen-2 tags have serialized TID numbers. 

These misconceptions contribute to the creation of a dangerous illusion of strong security, upon which end-users should not rely. As an attempt to clarify the misconceptions, this paper tries to draw a clearer picture of the capabilities and limitations of serialized TID numbers in security applications. This paper is especially important for applications operating on UHF tags, since passive cryptographic tags are not yet commercially available in that frequency range. 

This paper is organized as follows. We first provide a technical primer to TID numbers in Section II. We then evaluate how the TID checks can be broken or bypassed through all known vulnerabilities in Sections III and IV, and we compare this effort to the needed level of protection in an example of anti-counterfeiting in Section V. In Section VI we discuss and derive guidelines for using serialized TID numbers in security applications for end-user companies. 

II. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND OF TID NUMBERS

This section provides a detailed technical primer that is needed for the detailed evaluation of vulnerabilities presented in Sections III and IV.
