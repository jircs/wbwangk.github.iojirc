Abstract. This paper investigates a novel computational problem, namely the Composite Residuosity Class Problem, and its applications topublic-key cryptography. We propose a new trapdoor mechanism and
derive from this technique three encryption schemes : a trapdoor permutation and two homomorphic probabilistic encryption schemes computationally comparable to RSA. Our cryptosystems, based on usual modulararithmetics, are provably secure under appropriate assumptions in thestandard model.
